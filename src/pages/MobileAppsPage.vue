      <p>Modeled after the Explosives Safety Quantity Distance (ESQD) Calculator Excel Spreadsheet, the ESQD Mobile app can be used to calculate hazard classes and divisions 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, and 1.4 net explosive weight quantity distance (NEWQD) that can be stored in a potential explosion site (PES) or the distance required between a PES and an exposed site (ES). In addition to the calculator, Ammunition Managers, Ammunition Specialists, and Quality Assurance Specialist Ammunition Surveillance (QASAS) personnel can practice critical, on the job skills in the built-in gaming component. The game consists of 10 challenging scenarios that will not only utilize the mobile ESQD calculator, but also leverage knowledge of Army ESQD standards.</p>
